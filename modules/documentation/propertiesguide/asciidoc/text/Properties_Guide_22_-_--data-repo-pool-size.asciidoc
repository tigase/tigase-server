*Default value:* +10+

*Example:* +--data-repo-pool-size = 25+

*Possible values:* 'Number of db connections as integer.'

*Description:* +DataRepository+ is an abstraction layer between any higher level data access repositories such as +UserRepository+ or +AuthRepository+ and SQL database or JDBC driver to be more specific. Many implementations use +DataRepository+ for DB connections and in fact on many installations they also share the same DataRepository instance if they connect to the same DB. In such a case it is desired to specific a connection pool on this level to avoid excessive number of connections to the database.

It recommended to control number of DB connection using this property rather than --user-repo-pool-size or --auth-repo-pool-size.

*Available since:* 5.1.0
