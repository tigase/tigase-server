*Default value:* 'none'

*Example:* +--debug = server,xmpp.impl+

*Possible values:* 'comma separated list of Tigase\'s package names.'

*Description:* This property is used to turn on debugs log for selected tigase package. For example if you want to turn debug logs on for package: +tigase.server+ then you have to put parameter: +--debug server+. If you have any problems with your server the best way to get help from me is to generate configuration with '--debug = server' and run the server. Then from the +logs/tigase-console.log+ log file I can get all information I need to give you a help. More details about server logging and adjusting logging level is described in article Debugging Tigase.

*Available since:* 2.0.0
