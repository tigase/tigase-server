*Description:* Workaround for TLS/SSL bug in new JDK7 using native library for keys generation and connection encryption used with new version of nss library.

This caused number of problems with Tigase installed on system with JDK7 and the new library, such as hanging connections, or broken SSL/TLS. There was a short information on our link:https://projects.tigase.org/projects/tigase-server/wiki/Tigase_with_OpenJDK7_with_OpenSSL_101[wiki page]. Our earlier suggestion was to avoid using either JDK7 or the problematic native library. Now we have a proper fix/workaround which allows you to run Tigase with JDK7.
