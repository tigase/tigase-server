If you want to write a code for *Tigase* server you might want to use link:http://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse]. Here is a guide how to start working on source code using this IDE.

All you need to start is:

. Installed and working copy of link:http://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse]
. Installed and working copy of link:http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/ea.jsp[JDK-1.6.0Beta2] at least.
. Installed and working link:http://subclipse.tigris.org/[Subclipse] pluggin for Eclipse.


JDK-1.6.0 Setup
---------------
After installation JDK-1.6.0 in your operating system, run Eclipse and select  Window/Preferences.

In section Java/Installed JREs press *Add* button. In the new opened window enter path to installed JDK-6. In my case it is */opt/jdk1.6.0*. It also good to set name to *sun-jdk-1.6.0*.

Subclipse Installation
----------------------
As Eclipse doesn't contain built-in support for Subversion repositories you have to add new plugin.  Detailed instruction for Subclipse installation is on page:

link:http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html[subclipse.tigris.org/install.html].

Project Import
--------------
From menu File in Eclipse execute *Import*. Next, highlight section *Team/Team
Project Set* and press *Next*.

Enter file name *tigase-server.psf* in field *File* and press *Finish*.

The file is attached to this article.

Because link:http://www.tigase.net/user/1[kobit] has objections to add Eclipse configuration files to subversion repository you have to do it on your own.

That's it. Start hacking now!
