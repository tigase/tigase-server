== Tigase Tip: Checking Cluster Connections

:toc:

After setting up clustering one may want to verify that cluster is operational. Right now it can be done in two fold manner - first by checking that there are actuall network connections established between cluster nodes, the next step is to check internal status of the server.

=== Established connections

There are number of ways to check for opened connections, simplest one use command line. (Tigase uses port _5277_ for cluster connections)

* Linux
[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
$ lsof -iTCP:5277 -sTCP:ESTABLISHED -P -n
-------------------------------------

* Windows
[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
C:\WINNT>netstat -anp tcp | find ":5277 "
-------------------------------------

=== Cluster nodes connected (using XMPP)

Verifying clustering connectivity over XMPP protocol requires any XMPP client capable of http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html[XEP-0030: Service Discovery]. It's essential to remember, that only administrator (a user whose JID is configured as administrative) has access.

==== Psi XMPP Client

For the purpose of this guide a http://psi-im.org/[Psi] client will be used. After successfully configuring and connecting to account with administrative privileges we need to access _Service Discovery_, either from application menu or from context menu of the particular account account:

In the _Service Discovery_ window we need to find _Cluster Connection Manager_ component. After expanding the tree node for the component a list of all cluster nodes will be presented with the current status (either _connected_ or _disconnected_). Node column will contain actuall hostname of the cluster node:
