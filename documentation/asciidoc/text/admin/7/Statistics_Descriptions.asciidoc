Statistics are divided between data sources, components and processors.  You may see the same statistics collected for multiple components which are defined in common components section.
Note that statistics are defined by {$component}/statistic so if you wanted Max queue size on pubsub, you would look for +pubsub/Max queue size+.
Statistics will not be provided by components that are not enabled.

== Data source statistics
Data sources used to access data storages such as JDBC (databases) or MongoDB provide statistcs related to stability of connections to data storage and number of open connections.

|===================================================================================================
|Statistics Name |Description |Stastics Level |Format |List of Possible Stastics

|Number of active data sources |
Number of defined and active data sources (ie. connection pools). This is not a number of connections to data sources as it varies and is listed separately for every defined data source. |FINE |Integer |

== User repository statistics of {repo}

For every {method} declared in `UserRepository` we gather execution statistics. This statistics are collected separately for every data source for which user repository is defined.

|===================================================================================================

== Statistics common to custom {compname} component repositories

These statistics may be found in many components which are using repository implementations created just for them.
An example of such components may be:

amp:: with msgBroadcastRepository as {repo} name,
message-archive:: with repositoryPool as a {repo} name,
muc:: with muc-dao as a {repo} name,
pubsub:: with dao as a {repo} name,
sess-man:: with msgRepository as a {repo} name

For custom component repositories we gather statistics in a same way as we do for user and authorization repositories.
Statistics are collected on per {method} basis separately for every data source ({dataSourceName}) for which repository is defined.

== *Statistics common to components*

These statistics may be found in multiple components and may be seen multiple times.
For example both s2s and c2s will have Bytes received statistic, so each can be found the following way:
[source,properties]
-----
s2s/Bytes received
c2s/Bytes received
-----
