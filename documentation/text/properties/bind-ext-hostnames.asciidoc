*Default value:* none

*Example:* +--bind-ext-hostnames = pubsub.host.domain+

*Possible values:* 'comma separated list of domains.'

*Description:* This property enables setting a list of domains to be bound to the external component connection. Let's say we have a Tigase instance with only MUC and PubSub components loaded and we want to connect this instance to the main server via external component protocol. Using xref:external[--external property] we can define a domain (perhaps muc.devel.tigase.org), password, TCP/IP port, remote host address, connection type, etc... This would make one of our components (MUC) visible on the remote server.

To make the second component (PubSub) visible we would need to open another connection with the domain name (pubsub.devel.tigase.org) for the other component. Of course the second connection is redundant as all communication could go through a single connection. This is what this property is used. In our example with 2 components you can just put the 'pubsub.devel.tigase.org' domain as a value to this property and it will bind the second domain to a single connection on top of the domain which has been authenticated during protocol handshaking.

*Available since:* 5.0.0
