/**
 * <code>UserRepository</code> interface defines all functionalities required to store user data. It contains adding,

 * repository on different levels like files in file systems. Instead, however of working with directories you work with
 * nodes. You can create many levels of nodes and store data on any level. It helps to organize data in more logical
 * order.
