"When the user tries to setup the client for the first time he comes "
"across 2 configuration files: ``tigase.conf`` and ``config.tdsl`` in the "

":ref:`config.tdsl<dslConfig>` file is a simple text file with server "
"parameters in form: **key** = **value**. When the XML configuration file "
"is missing the Tigase server reads ``config.tdsl`` file and uses "
"parameters found there as defaults for generation of the XML file. "
"Therefore if you change the ``config.tdsl`` file you normally have to "
"stop the server, remove the XML file and start the server again. All the "
"settings from the ``config.tdsl`` are read and applied to the XML "
"configuration. The properties file is easy to read and very safe to "
"modify. At the moment this is the recommended way change the server "

":ref:`tigase.conf<manualconfig>` is the Tigase server startup "
"configuration. It is actually not used by the server itself. It rather "
"contains operating system settings and environment parameters to "
"correctly run the `Java Virtual Machine "
"<https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/>`__. It is only useful on the "
"unix-like systems with Bash shell. If you run the server on MS Windows "
"systems ``tigase.bat`` and ``wrapper.conf`` files are used instead. The "
"``tigase.conf`` file is read and loaded by the ``scripts/tigase.sh`` "
"shell script which also scans the operating system environment for Java "
"VM and other tools needed."

"DSL configuration format provides a number of advantages over the old "
"system of configuration. All configurations for components are related in"
" a single block, so they are not spread out over several different lines."
" No need for long property names, no longer have to invoke a long string "
"of settings for multiple values. Support is provided for environment "
"variables. No longer need to escape certain characters, making settings "
"far more readable at a glance. Values may be set using basic "
"calculations, such as ``100 * 200 * 2`` rather than ``40000``. Parameter "
"type values are no longer necessary, no more [i], [S], [B] etc.. Comma "
