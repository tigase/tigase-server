"The server side is actually the biggest difference and advantage. Many "
"companies have offices in different locations, and such instant messaging"
" technology could be very useful to employees for communication. "
"Companies are not inclined to allow confidential discussions to go "

"XMPP servers on the other hand, allows you to deploy server software on "
"your own company network. Employees can then talk securely and all "
"information remains on the company’s secure network. Of course if offices"
" are located in different locations or countries then all messages are "
"transmitted over the public network - the Internet. This is not a problem"

"you protect your discussion."
