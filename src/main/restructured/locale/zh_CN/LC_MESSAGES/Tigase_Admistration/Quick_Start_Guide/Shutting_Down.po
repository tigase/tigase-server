"Although Tigase XMPP Server can be terminated by ending the process, it "
"is preferred and recommended to use it’s own shutdown scripts instead. "
"Not only does this allow for a proper purge of Tigase form the system, "
"but allows for all shutdown functions to operate, such as amending logs "
"and completing statistics. To trigger a shutdown of Tigase server, the "
"following command can be used from the tigase directory:"
