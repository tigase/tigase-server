"Client to server communication is an integral part of XMPP communication."
" C2S handles all client communication to the server, and is responsible "
"for filtering and handling remote communications. C2S CAN be disabled, "
"however doing so will only allow communication of internal components, "
"and S2S communications."

msgid ""
"The property allows you to limit how many new users' connection per "
"second the server accepts on a particular port. Connections established "
"within the limit are processed normally, all others are simply "
"disconnected. This allows you to avoid server overload in case there is a"
" huge number of users trying to connect at the same time. Mostly this "
"happens after a server restart."

msgstr ""

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/Components/C2S.rst:57
msgid ""
"It is now possible to set a default stream resumption timeout that the "
"server uses. This allows control of how long a server will wait for a "
"reconnection from a client. This can be particularly helpful to manage "
"mobile clients connecting to your server as they may not have complete "
"coverage, and you do not want to close the stream right away. By default,"
" Tigase sets this value to 60 seconds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/Components/C2S.rst:67
msgid ""
"This sets the default timeout to 90 seconds. You may, if you choose, "
"specify a maximum timeout time, which will allow the server to wait "
"between the default and maximum before a connection is closed."

msgid ""
"Normally packets are handled by C2S and are typically processed in the "
"first run, however if that fails to send, a retry of sending that packet "
"will occur after 60 seconds. If that second try fails, the delay will "
"increase by a factor of 1.5. This means that the next retry will occur at"
" 90, 135, and so on until the retry count is reached. By default this "
"count is 15, however it can be changed by using the following setting:"

"This setting prevents packet redelivery attempts from continuing into "
"infinity (or when the host machine runs out of memory)."
