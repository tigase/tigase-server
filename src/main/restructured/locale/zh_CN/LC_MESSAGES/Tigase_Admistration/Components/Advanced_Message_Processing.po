"Even though the whole functionality is implemented inside the component "
"you need a way to forward messages with ``AMP`` payload to that "
"component. This is what the ``amp`` plugin does. The ``amp`` plugin "
"intercepts all ``<message/>`` packets even without AMP payload, "
"redirecting some of the to the ``AMP`` component and others processing in"
" a standard way. Therefore you no longer need ``message`` plugin or "
"``msgoffline`` plugin. Those are all functions are offered by the ``amp``"
" plugin now. Hence you have to switch ``message`` and ``msgoffline`` "
"plugins off (the ``amp`` plugin is loaded by default):"

"The ``amp`` plugin needs to know where to forward all the ``AMP`` "
