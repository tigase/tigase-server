"Tigase offers different ways to filter XMPP packets flying through the "
"server. The most common use for packet filtering is to restrict users "
"from sending or receiving packets based on the sender or received "
"address."

"There are also different possible scenarios: time based filtering, "

"Domain based packet filtering is a simple filter allowing to restrict "
"user communication based on the source/destination domain name. This is "
"especially useful if we want to limit user communication within a single "
"- own domain only or a list of domains."

"A company might not wish to allow employers to chat during work hours "

"The restriction is on a per-user basis. So the administrator can set a "

"Those rules applicable to particular users are stored in the user "
