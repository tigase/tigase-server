"If you want to enable or disable one of password-based authentication "
"mechanism such as ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` or ``SCRAM-SHA-512``"
" you can do that by enabling or disabling encoders and decoders used on "
"your installation. By enabling encoders/decoders you are deciding in what"
" form the password is stored in the database. Those changes may (and in "
"most cases will) impact which SASL mechanisms may be allowed to use on "
"your installation."

"In most cases you should enable or disable both (credentials encoder and "
"decoder) of the same type at the same time. The only exception of this "
"rule is when you are changing those on already working installation. In "
"this case you should only enable encoder of the type which you want to "
"enable and request users to change their passwords. Then, after users "
"will change their passwords, you should reconfigure server to enable "
"decoder of the particular type. *(in other case user may loose a way to "
"log in to your installation as system will reject their credentials as it"
" may not have matching credentials for particular SASL mechanism)*."
