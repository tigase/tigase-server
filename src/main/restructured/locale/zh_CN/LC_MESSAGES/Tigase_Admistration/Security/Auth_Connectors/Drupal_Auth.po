"Implementation of a **Drupal** database based authorization is located in"
" ``tigase.db.jdbc.DrupalAuth`` class. Although this class is capable of "
"adding new users to the repository I recommend to switch in-band "
"registration off due to the caching problems in **Drupal.** Changes in "
"database are not synchronized with **Drupal** yet. Functionality for "
"adding new users is implemented only to ease user accounts migration from"
" different repository types from earlier **Tigase** server installations."

"**Tigase** server uses following fields from **Drupal** database: name "
"(user account name), pass (user account password), status (status of the "

"then server wonâ€™t allow user to login trough XMPP even if user provides "
"valid password."
