"Tigase allows adjusting the most important parameters used when "
"establishing TLS connections - set of protocols and ciphers that will be "
"used during negotiation of the connection. The single most important is "
"``hardened-mode`` - it’s the most general configuration and offers three-"
"step adjustment of the settings - please see `??? <#hardenedMode>`__ for "
"details. ``hardened-mode`` can be configured both via TDSL configuration "
"file (either on ``root`` level or for ``sslContextContainer`` for "
"particular connection managers) or on VHost level."

"If you want to disable certain protocols or ciphers you can use two "
"options: ``tls-disabled-protocols`` and ``tls-disabled-ciphers`` "
"respectively. They allow, as name suggests, disabling certain items from "
"default sets. They both takes an array of strings, which ten be removed "
"from the lists."

"Let’s say you’d like to remove support for ``SSL``, ``SSLv2`` and "
"``SSLv3`` protocols. You should simply use following configuraiton: "
"``'tls-disabled-protocols' = ['SSL', 'SSLv2', 'SSLv3']``. Complete list "
"of protocols depends on particular Java version that you use - please "
"refer to the documentation for details. For example for the default "
"Java11 list you can check `SSLContext Algorithms "
"<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/security/standard-"

"``tls-disabled-ciphers`` follows same format and uses names defined in "
"`JSSE Cipher Suite Names "
"<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/security/standard-"
"names.html#jsse-cipher-suite-names>`__. It’s also possible to use regular"
" expressions to quickly eliminate groups of ciphers."

"If you want to enable only specific protocols or ciphers irrespective of "
"``hardened-mode`` or above disabling options you can use ``tls-enabled-"
"protocols`` and ``tls-enabled-ciphers`` - those two options take arrays "
"as well and they will configure Tigase to use only those protocols or "
"ciphers that are provided (without support for regular expressions). "
"Therefore if you configure Tigase with ``'tls-enabled-protocols' = [ "
"'TLSv1.2' ]`` then **only** ``TLSv1.2`` will be supported by Tigase."

"``hardened-mode`` setting (and switch it to ``strict``)."
