"It has happened recently that we have tried very hard to fix a few "
"annoying problems on one of the Tigase installations. Whatever we did, "

"It turned out that due to specific environment settings on the target "
"system, an old version of Tigase server was always started regardless of "

" should select one random node from list of available nodes and always "

"As mentioned in Tip #1 WebSocket endpoint is plain TLS/SSL port, so it "

"matches our domain. But If we host multiple domain we cannot use "
"``wss://example1.com:5291/`` connection URL, if our default certificate "
"is for domain ``example2.com``. In this situation it is recommended to "
"use the default certificate for the domain under which the server is "
"accessible from the internet. This domain should identify this server, so"
" this domain would not point to two nodes of a cluster. After we deploy "
"separate certificate for each of cluster nodes, we should follow same tip"
" as Tip #1 for BOSH. Our web-based XMPP client should have knowledge "
"about each node of a cluster and when it needs to connect it should "
"randomly select one node from list of available cluster nodes and try to "
"connect using connection URL that would contain name of server under "

"connect using WebSocket encrypted protocol to host ``t2.example1.com`` "
"using the following URL: ``wss://t2.example1.com:5291/``. Upon connection"
" the client should still send example2.com as name of server to which it "
