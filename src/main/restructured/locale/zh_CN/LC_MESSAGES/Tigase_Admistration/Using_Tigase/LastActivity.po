"To lower impact on performance, by default last activity information is "
"persisted to repository less frequently. This can yield slightly less "
"accurate results on installations with multiple cluster nodes with users "
"having multiple resources connected. To get more accurate results you "
"should set ``persistAllToRepository`` to ``true``, which will cause all "
"update times to be persisted (please bear in mind that this could cause "
"higher impact on the repository)."
