msgstr ""

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/MIX_Component.rst:51
msgid ""
"The most stark difference to MUC is that MIX requires support from both "
"server that hosts the channel and user’s server. This is done to "
"facilitate the notion that the user (and not particular connection or "
"client application) joined the group and allows for greater flexibility "
"in terms of message delivery (which can be send to one or many "
"connections, or even generates notification over PUSH). Another important"
" difference is the flexibility to choose which notifications from the "
"channel user wants to receive (that can be messages, presence, "
"participators or node information). In the most basic approach, when user"
" decides to join a channel, it sends an IQ stanza to it’s own local "
"server indicating address of the desired channel and list of MIX nodes to"
" which it wants to subscribe. User’s server then forward’s subscription "
"request to the destination, MIX server. As a result user receives "
"subscription confirmation and from this point onwards will receive "
"notifications from the channel, independently of it’s current network "
"connection. Another essential bit of MIX is the reliance on `XEP-0313: "
"Message Archive Management <https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html>`__"
" to control message history and the complementary interaction between MIX"
" server and user’s server. Main channel history is handled by the MIX "
"server, but user’s that joined the channel will retrieve and synchronise "
"message history querying their local server, which will maintain complete"
" history of the channels that user has joined (based on the received "
"notifications). This also means that even if the channel is removed, user"
" is still able to access it’s history through local MAM archive (limited "
"to time when user was member of the channel). As a result, chatter "
"between client, client’s server and mix server is also reduced and "
"unnecessary traffic is eliminated."

msgid ""
"All of this helps especially with clients that relay on constrained "
"environment - be that unreliable network connection or operating system "
"that limits time that application can be running. Because there is no "
"dependency on the dynamic state of user presence/connection the issue "
"with occupant leaving and (re)joining the room is eliminated - user gets "
"the notification always. What’s more, thanks to shared responsibilities "
"between MIX and user’s server, and the latter getting all notifications "
"from MIX channel, it’s possible to generate notifications without "
"relaying on workarounds (that most of the time are not reliable or impact"
" resource usage)."
