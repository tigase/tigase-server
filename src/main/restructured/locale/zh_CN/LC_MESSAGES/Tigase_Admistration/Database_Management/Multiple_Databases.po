"Splitting user authentication data from all other XMPP information such "
"as roster, vcards, etc…​ was almost always possible in Tigase XMPP "
"Server. Possible and quite simple thing to configure. Also it has been "
"always possible and easy to assign a different database for each Tigase "
"component (MUC, PubSub, AMP), for recording the server statistics. Almost"
" every data type or component can store information in a different "
"location, simple and easy to setup through the configuration file."

"However it is much less known that it is also possible to have a "
"different database for each virtual domain. This applies to both the user"
" repository and authentication repository. This allows for very "
"interesting configuration such as user database sharing where each shard "
"keeps users for a specific domain, or physically split data based on "
"virtual domain if each domain refers to a different customer or group of "
"people."

"This configuration defines just a default databases for both user "

"there is no repository specified for a particular virtual domain. "
"However, you can have a separate, both user and authentication repository"
" for each virtual domain."

"As you can see, it requires some writing but flexibility is very "
"extensive and you can setup as many separate databases as you need or "
"want. If one database (recognized by the database connection string) is "
"shared among different VHosts, Tigase still uses a single connection "
"pool, so it won’t create an excessive number of connections to the "
"database."
