"**Description:** This property enables setting a list of domains to be "
"bound to the external component connection. Let’s say we have a Tigase "
"instance with only MUC and PubSub components loaded and we want to "
"connect this instance to the main server via external component protocol."
" Using `--external property <#external>`__ we can define a domain "
"(perhaps muc.devel.tigase.org), password, TCP/IP port, remote host "
"address, connection type, etc…​ This would make one of our components "
"(MUC) visible on the remote server."

"To make the second component (PubSub) visible we would need to open "
"another connection with the domain name (pubsub.devel.tigase.org) for the"
" other component. Of course the second connection is redundant as all "
"communication could go through a single connection. This is what this "
"property is used. In our example with 2 components you can just put the "
"'pubsub.devel.tigase.org' domain as a value to this property and it will "
"bind the second domain to a single connection on top of the domain which "
"has been authenticated during protocol handshaking."
