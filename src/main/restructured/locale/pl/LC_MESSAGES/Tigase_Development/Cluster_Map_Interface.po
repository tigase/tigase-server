"Starting with v7.1.0, a cluster map interface has been implemented. The "
"cluster map is aided by use of the distributed event bus system to "
"communicate between all clusters."

"Any full distribution of Tigase will support the Cluster Map API so long "
"as the eventbus component is not disabled. JDK v8 is required for this "
"feature, however since Tigase requires this, you should already have it "
"installed."

"The cluster map is stored in memory and follows the "
"``map.util.interface`` java standards can be used to improve cluster "

"Where \"type\" is the map ID. This creates the map locally and then fires"
" an event to all clustered servers. Each cluster server has an event "
"handler waiting for, in this case, ``NewMapCreate`` event. Map Key class "
"and Map Value class are used to type conversion. Arrays of strings are "
"parameters, for example ID of user session. Once received, the "
"distributed eventbus will create a local map."

"Strings \"Very_Important_Map_In_User_Session\" and \"user-session-"
"identifier-123\" are given as parameters in :literal:`onMapCreated()\\`` "
"method. The event consumer code must know what to do with map with type "
"\"Very_Important_Map_In_User_Session\". It may retrieve user session "
"\"user-session-identifier-123\" and put this map in this session. It "
"should be used to tell other nodes how to treat the event with a newly "
"created map, and it should be stored in user session."
