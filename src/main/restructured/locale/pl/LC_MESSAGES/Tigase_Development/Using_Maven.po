"Here at Tigase, we employ Apache Maven to download latest builds, compile"
" codes for export, and check for errors in the code during build. This "
"guide will go over installing and running Maven from a Windows operating "
"environment. We will consider windows versions 7, 8, and 8.1 for this "
"guide. Because Maven does not come with an installer, there is a manual "
"install process which might be a bit daunting for the new user, but setup"
" and use is fairly simple."

"Maven requires Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 or later. As Tigase requires "

"Once you install JDK and restart your machine, be sure that you have the "
