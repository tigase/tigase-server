"It is possible to enforce Tigase mDNS component to check if there is no "
"other host providing services for chosen domain name. By setting property"
" ``singleServer`` to ``true``. If this feature is enabled, then mDNS "
"component checks if chosen domain is already in use (broadcasted in "
"multicast DNS) and if so it stops startup of the server. This feature "
"make it possible to start up Tigase and broadcast XMPP server mDNS "
"information if already existing mDNS information resolves to the IP "
"address of the host on which you are starting Tigase XMPP Server."
