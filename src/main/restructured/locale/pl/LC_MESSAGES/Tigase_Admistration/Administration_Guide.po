"Tigase’s Watchdog was implemented to help Tigase close connections that "

"connection is re-established, both server and client (or server and "
"server) will continue on as if nothing happened. However, these gaps in "
"connection can last longer, and some installations will rely on the "
"operating system to detect and close stale connections. Some operating "
"systems or environments can take up to 2 hours or more to determine "
"whether a connection is bad and wait for a response from a foreign entity"
