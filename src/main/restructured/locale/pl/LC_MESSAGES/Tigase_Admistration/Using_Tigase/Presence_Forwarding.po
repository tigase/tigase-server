"Presence forward address can be any XMPP address. Usually you want it to "
"be a bot address which can collect your users' presence information. Once"
" this option is set to a valid XMPP address Tigase forwards user’s "
"presence, every time the user changes his status. The presence is "
"processed normally, of course, and distributed to all people from the "
"contact list (roster), plus to this special address. It can be a "
"component or a bot. If this is a bot connecting to a regular XMPP "
"account, **Make sure the presence forward address contains resource part "
"and the bot is connecting with this resource.** Otherwise the presence "
"won’t be delivered to the bot."

"If you have your own Tigase installation, the forwarding address can be "

"Now, the big question. How this can be used? I am attaching below an "
"example code. With just a few lines of code you can connect a command "
"line bot to the server as a client which would collect all presences from"
" users. Code below is a simple Groovy script which receives presence "
"packet and displays them on the console. However, it should be easy "
"enough to store users' presence information in a database and then load "
"it from a web application."
