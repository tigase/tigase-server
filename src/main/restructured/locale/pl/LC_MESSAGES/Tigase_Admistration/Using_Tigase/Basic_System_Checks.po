"Previously, a configuration article is available about `Linux settings "
"for high load systems <#linuxhighload>`__. This has a description of "
"basic settings which are essential to successfully run XMPP service for "
"hundreds or thousands of online users."

"Of course, high load and high traffic systems require much more tuning "
"and adjustments. If you use selinux you have to be careful as it can "
"interfere with the service while it is under a high load. Also some "
"firewall settings may cause problems as the system may decide it is under"
" a DDOS attack and can start blocking incoming connections or throttle "
"the traffic."

"In any case, there are some basic checks to do every time you deploy XMPP"
" service to make sure it will function properly. I am trying to keep the "
"article mentioned above up to date and add all the settings and "
"parameters I discover while working with different installations. *If you"
" have some suggestions for different values or different parameters to "
"add, please let me know.*"

"If you want to run a service on a few cluster nodes (5 or even 10), then "
"manually checking every machine and adjusting these settings is time "
"consuming and it is very easy to forget about."

"To overcome this problem I started to work on a shell script which would "
"run all the basic checks and report problems found. Ideally it should be "
"also able to adjust some parameters for you."

"Inside the Tigase server `scripts/ <https://github.com/tigase/tigase-"
"server/blob/master/scripts/>`__ repository find a script called "
"``machine-check.sh``. It performs all the basic checks from the article "
"and also tries to adjust them when necessary. Have a `look at the code "
"<https://github.com/tigase/tigase-server/blob/master/scripts/machine-"
"check.sh>`__ and run for yourself."
