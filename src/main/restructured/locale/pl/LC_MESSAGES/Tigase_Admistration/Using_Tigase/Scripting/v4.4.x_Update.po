"Scripting functionality is quite useful in Tigase server for all sorts of"
" administrator tasks. The possibility to load new scripts or replace old "
"ones at the server runtime opens quite new area for the service "
"maintenance."

"In earlier versions of the Tigase server scripting capabilities was "
"available only in the session manager component while it might be very "
"useful in many other places - connection managers, MUC, PubSub, "
"VHostManager and what even more important in completely new, custom "
"components created for specific needs. It would be quite wasteful to "
"reinvent the wheel every time and implementing scripting capabilities for"
" each component separately."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/Using_Tigase/Scripting/v4.4.x_Update.rst:8
msgid ""
"Therefore the scripting capabilities has been implemented in the core of "
"the Tigase server. It is now part of the API and is automatically "
"available to all components without any additional coding. A detailed "
"developer guide will be published separately."

"Please note. The description and screenshots are taken from the Psi "
"client and most likely interface for ad-hoc commands and service "
"discovery on other client looks different. I recommend to do some initial"
" testing and experiments using Psi client and then switch to your "
"preferred application for your day-to-day use."

"This had to be done for many reasons. One of them is, obviously, the "
"cleaner access to the main server stuff. Another, probably more "
"important, is to avoid a long list of commands for different components "
"mixed together. Commands for different components can have the same "
"name/description and they can even do similar things but they are "
"executed on a different server component. To avoid any confusion and "
"minimize opportunities for mistake the commands are now closely tight to "
"their components. To access a list of commands for a particular component"
" you have to double click on the component name on the list or click "
"'Execute command\" icon on top of the window when your component is "
"selected."

"A new window should show up with drop-down list of available commands. "

"There has been also a small change made to the script adding window. As "
"you can see on the screenshot there is one additional option added - "
"\"Save to disk\". This means that once you submitted the script to the "

"This option is enabled by default as this seems to be a logical choice "
