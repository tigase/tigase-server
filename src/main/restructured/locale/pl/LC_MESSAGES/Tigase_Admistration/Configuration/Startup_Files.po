"Another significant setting is \\\\'**CLASSPATH**'. It is intentionally "

"**CLASSPATH** on itâ€™s own from files found in **jars/** and **libs/** "
"directories. It is advised to set the **CLASSPATH** to the empty string "
"because the Tigase server scans all available classes to find all "
"components and plugins implementation. If the **CLASSPATH** contains lots"
" of libraries which are not used anyway it can cause a long startup time "
"and high system loads."
