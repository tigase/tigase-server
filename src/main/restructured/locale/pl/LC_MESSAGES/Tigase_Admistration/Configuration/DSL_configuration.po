"DSL configuration format provides a number of advantages over the old "

" a single block, so they are not spread out over several different lines."
" No need for long property names, no longer have to invoke a long string "
"of settings for multiple values. Support is provided for environment "
"variables. No longer need to escape certain characters, making settings "
"far more readable at a glance. Values may be set using basic "
"calculations, such as ``100 * 200 * 2`` rather than ``40000``. Parameter "
"type values are no longer necessary, no more [i], [S], [B] etc.. Comma "
"separated values can now be simplified lists with separate entries being "
"able to be in multiple lines."
