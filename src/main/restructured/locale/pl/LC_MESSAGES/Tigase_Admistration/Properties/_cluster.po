"**Description:** The property is used to specify a list of cluster nodes "

"machine running the node. Please note the proper DNS configuration is "
"critical for the cluster to work correctly. Make sure the 'hostname' "
"command returns a full DNS name on each cluster node. Nodes don’t have to"
" be in the same network although good network connectivity is also a "
"critical element for an effective cluster performance."

"All cluster nodes must be connected with each other to maintain user "
"session synchronization and exchange packets between users connected to "
"different nodes. Therefore each cluster node opens a 'cluster port' on "
"which it is listening for connections from different cluster nodes. As "
"there is only one connection between each two nodes Tigase server has to "
"decide which nodes to connect to and which has to accept the connection. "
"If you put the same list of cluster nodes in the configuration for all "
"nodes this is not a problem. Tigase server has a way to find and void any"
" conflicts that are found. If you however want to add a new node later "
"on, without restarting and changing configuration on old nodes, there is "
"no way the old nodes will try to establish a connection to the new node "
"they don’t know them. To solve this particular case the next parameter is"
" used."
