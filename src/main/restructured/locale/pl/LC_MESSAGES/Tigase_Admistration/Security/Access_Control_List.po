"By default, all administration commands are only accessible (visible "

"The following is a list of possible ACL modifiers for administrator "

"``ALL`` - Everybody can execute the command, even users from different "
"federated servers."
msgstr ""

"``ADMIN`` - Local server administrators can execute the command, this is "
"a default setting if no ACL is set for a command."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/Security/Access_Control_List.rst:16
msgid ""
"``LOCAL`` - All users with accounts on the local server can execute the "
"command. Users from other, federated servers will not be able to execute "
"the command."

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/Security/Access_Control_List.rst:18
msgid "``NONE`` - No one will be allowed to execute this command"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/Security/Access_Control_List.rst:20
msgid ""
"``DOMAIN_OWNER`` - Only user which is owner of the domain which items are"
" being manipulated is allowed to execute the comment. If script is not "
"checking permissions for the manipulated item, this value will behave in "
"the same way as ``LOCAL``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/Security/Access_Control_List.rst:22
msgid ""
"``DOMAIN_ADMIN`` - Only user which is one of the domain administrators "
"will be able to execute the command manipulating items related to the "

"this value will behave in the same way as ``LOCAL``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Tigase_Admistration/Security/Access_Control_List.rst:24
msgid ""
"``example.com`` - Only users with accounts on the selected domain will be"
" able to execute the command. It may be useful to setup a domain "
"specifically for admin accounts, and automatically all users within that "
"domain would be able to run the command."

"Multiple ACL modifiers can be combined and applied for any command. This "
"may not always makes sense. For example ALL supersedes all other "
"settings, so it does not make sense to combine it with any other "
"modifier. However, most others can be combined with JID to broaden access"
" to specific accounts."

"On Tigase server the Access Control List is checked for the first "
"matching modifier. Therefore if you combine ALL with any other modifier, "

" command, no matter what other modifiers are added."

"Please note, the ACL lists work on the command framework level. Access is"
" verified before the command is actually executed. There might be "
"additional access restrictions within a command itself. In many cases, "
"even if all local users are permitted to execute a command (LOCAL "
"modifier), some commands allow only to be executed by a domain owner or a"
" domain administrator (and of course by the service-wide administrators "
"as well). All the commands related to a user management such as adding a "
"new user, removing a user, password changes, etc… belong to this "
"category. When conducting domain (vhost) management, "
"creation/registration of a new domain can be done by any local user (if "
"LOCAL ACL modifier is set) but then all subsequent domain management "
"tasks such as removing the vhost, updating its configuration, setting SSL"
" certificate can be done by the domain owner or administrator only."

"The ACL list is set for a specific Tigase component and a specific "

"To be able to set a correct ACL property you need to know component names"

"command ID can be found in the command script source code. Each script "
"contains a list of metadata at the very beginning of it’s code. One of "
"them is ``AS:CommandId`` which is what you have to use for the ACL "
"setting."
