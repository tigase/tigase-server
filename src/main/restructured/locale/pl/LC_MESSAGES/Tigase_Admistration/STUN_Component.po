"STUN stands for Simple Traversal of UDP[User Datagram Protocol] Through "
"NAT[Network Address Translators]. It allows for computers behind a NAT "
"router to host and provide UDP information without having to create rule "
"exceptions on the router, or provide specific information to the NAT "
"service. When specified within Tigase, XMPP and UDP communications can be"
" directed to a specific STUN server which will then handle incoming "
"requests to your network. You may use a public, or your own STUN server "
"with Tigase."
