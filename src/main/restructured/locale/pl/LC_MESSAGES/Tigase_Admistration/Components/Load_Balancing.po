"Tigase includes load balancing functionality allowing users to be "
"redirected to the most suitable cluster node. Functionality relies on a "
"see-other-host XMPP stream error message. The basic principle behind the "
"mechanism is that user will get redirect if the host returned by the "
"implementation differ from the host to which user currently tries to "
"connect. It is required that the user JID to be known for the redirection"
" to work correctly."
