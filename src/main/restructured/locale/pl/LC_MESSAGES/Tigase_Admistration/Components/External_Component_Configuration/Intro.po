"Configuration follows the same standards as all other components. It is "
"also much more powerful as a single Tigase instance can control many "
"TCP/IP ports and many external components on each port and even allows "
"for multiple connections for the same component. It supports both "
"XEP-0114 and XEP-0225 with protocol auto-detection mechanisms. Protocols "
"are pluggable so more protocols can be supported or custom extensions to "
"existing protocols can be added."
