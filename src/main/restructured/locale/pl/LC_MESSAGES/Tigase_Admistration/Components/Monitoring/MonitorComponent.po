"Tigase includes an **Monitor Component** to help with monitoring has been"
" implemented. This allows you to set thresholds for certain predefined "
"tasks and you or other JIDs can be sent a message when those thresholds "
"are passed. You can even configure a mailer extension to have an E-mail "
"sent to system administrators to let them know an event has occurred! "
"Lets begin with setup and requirements."
