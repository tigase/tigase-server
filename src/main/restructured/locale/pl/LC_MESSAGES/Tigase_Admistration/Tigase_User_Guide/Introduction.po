"This is very much like sending e-mail but the difference between Jabber "
"and e-mail is the same as the difference between sending a traditional "
"mail and talking on the phone."

"All messages sent through Jabber are sent instantly and you also receive "
"responses instantly. More over you can see whether your mate is online "
"and available for talking or not."

"XMPP is an open standard which means everybody can know how it works, "
"everybody can implement their own software connecting to the network both"
" client and server side."

"The server side is actually the biggest difference and advantage. Many "
"companies have offices in different locations, and such instant messaging"
" technology could be very useful to employees for communication. "
"Companies are not inclined to allow confidential discussions to go "
"outside the company’s network. Especially if it is not very secure to "
"leave such information on third party public servers."

"XMPP servers on the other hand, allows you to deploy server software on "
"your own company network. Employees can then talk securely and all "
"information remains on the company’s secure network. Of course if offices"
" are located in different locations or countries then all messages are "
"transmitted over the public network - the Internet. This is not a problem"
" since XMPP supports SSL/TLS - secure encrypted connections which helps "
"you protect your discussion."

"Then if your employees need to contact customers outside your company, "
"the whole discussion can go through your server and a server located on "
"the customer side."

"There are many other scenarios and use cases but I hope this brief "
