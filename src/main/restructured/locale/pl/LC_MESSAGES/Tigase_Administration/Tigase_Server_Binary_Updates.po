"Most open source projects try to make sure that the nightly builds "
"compile correctly so that these builds can be used. However, we at Tigase"
" believe that these builds should be separated until they are thoroughly "
"tested and released. Although lots of installations out there we know of "
"just run from our nightly builds, this puts an extra responsibility to "
"make sure all code is functional and will constantly work. Therefore, our"
" general approach is to run all basic functionality tests before each "
"code commit to make sure it works correctly. This does not guarantee that"
" there will never be a problem, but it is a precaution from preventing "
"bad builds from arriving in the hands of our customers."

"Some users on the other hand, like to be on the bleeding edge and "
"regularly use our nightly builds exploring new code changes and playing "
"with new features before they are put to a full release. Others prefer to"
" stick to stable and fully tested public releases. Others however, want "
"something from the middle, the most recent features, but bug fixes, "
"something like a beta or a release-candidate state."
