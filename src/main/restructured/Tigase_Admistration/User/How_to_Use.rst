This Article Describes How to use **tigase.im** Service for Instant Communications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have to install and run a Jabber client application to use the service.

There are multiple domains available: tigase.im, sure.im, xmpp.cloud (and you can host your own domain as well)


Short instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usually you just need to enter the user name of the form: user@tigase.im. Your XMPP client should take care of all other things as our service doesn’t need any special settings. If you don’t have an account on tigase.im server yet just tick the option to register new account. That’s it!


**Long Instructions:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good news is that there are many programs to choose from which allow you to communicate through our server. So you can pick up your favorite application or use an existing one that is compatible and start using our service.

All clients presented below support multiple accounts on Jabber servers. What this means is that you can have a few Jabber accounts on different Jabber servers and you can still use just one program to connect to all of them at the same time.
