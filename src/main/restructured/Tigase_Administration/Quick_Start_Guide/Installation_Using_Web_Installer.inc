Installation Using Web Installer
-----------------------------------

When Tigase XMPP Server starts up, it looks for the default configuration file: ``etc/config.tdsl``. If this file has not been modified you can run the web installer. Which will step you through the process of configuring Tigase. If you are installing Tigase in a Windows environment, please see the :ref:`Windows Installation<winWebInstall>` section.


Download and Extract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First download Tigase XMPP Server and extract it. You can download the `official binaries <https://tigase.net/downloads>`__, or the latest and greatest `nightly builds <https://build.tigase.net/nightlies/dists/>`__. Once you have the distribution binary extract it and navigate to the directory:

.. code:: bash

   $ tar -xf tigase-server-<version>-dist-max.tar.gz
   $ cd tigase-server-<version>


.. Tip::

   Do not run as root user!


Start the Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Note::

   Please make sure ``JAVA_HOME`` is set and points to your JVM installation

.. code:: bash

   scripts/tigase.sh start etc/tigase.conf


Verify Tigase is ready to start installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tigase should start listening on port 8080 - you can check it using ``lsof`` command:

.. code:: bash

   $ lsof -i -P
   COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
   java    18387 tigase  141u  IPv6 22185825      0t0  TCP *:8080 (LISTEN)

You can also check console log under ``logs/tigase-console.log``, which should point you directly to the installer.

.. _connecttoWebInstall:

Connect to the Web Installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some points before you can connect:

This setup page is restricted access, however for first setup there is a default account set to setup Tigase: Username: ``admin`` Password: ``tigase``

This combination will only be valid once as it will be removed from ``config.tdsl`` file on completion of setup process. After this point the setup page will only be accessible using the following:

1. JID accounts listed as administrators in admins line in ``config.tdsl`` file.

2. Username and password combinations added to ``config.tdsl`` file manually, or at the last page in this process.

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/setup/ unless you are working remotely. You can also use the domain name, or IP address.

Enter the username and password above to gain access.


Step Through the Installation Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will be greeted by the following "About software" page.

|web install 01|

Read it and then click "Next"

The setup consists of several steps that help you configure your installation: selecting features and providing database configuration.

.. Note::

   Order and design of the steps may slightly differ thus we only provide a broad overview of how to proceed:

1. **Advanced Clustering Strategy information**

   You will see some information about our commercial products and licensing. Please read though the agreement, and as a confirmation of agreement type in your name or company and click "Next" to go to the next page.

2. **Basic Tigase server configuration**

   This page will look over your basic configuration settings, those include the server type, domain you wish to use, and gives you a chance to specify an administrator for the domain. Also, you will be selecting what type of database Tigase server will be using (configuration comes later).

   If you do not specify an administrator and password, one is made for you, which will be admin@yourdomain and password is tigase.

3. **Connectivity**

   At this page you will be presented with a list of possible connectivity options supported by Tigase XMPP Server and a way to enable/disable each of them (desktop, mobile, http, websocket, federation, etc.). After making this decisions, click "Next".

4. **Features**

   Now you will be able to select which features of Tigase XMPP Server (such as MUC, PubSub, MIX, MAM, Push Notifications) should be enabled or disabled.

   At this step will also be able to enable clustering on your installation

   When you will be ready, click "Next".

5. **Database configuration**

   This is where the database is configured. The type of database selected in step 3 will influence available options. **BE SURE TO SPECIFY DATABASE ROOT USER ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD**

6. **Database connectivity check**

   After database setup, you should see a page with executed actions and their results. All presented items should be "green", meaning that everything went well. If anything is presented in "red" or "yellow", please read description presented below this header to learn more about this issue. If setup is completed, click "Next".

7. **Setup security**

   The Setup Access Page will be locked from the admin/tigase user as specified above. This is your chance to have the setup pages add a specific user in addition to admin accounts to re-access this setup process later. If left blank, only JIDs listed in admin will be allowed to access.

8. **Saving configuration**

   The installation is almost complete and you will be presented with a page showing what the resulting configuration (stored in ``config.tdsl`` file) will look like.

   If you have a custom setup, or would like to put your own settings in, you may copy and past the contents here to edit the current ``config.tdsl`` file.

   Click "Save" to write the file to disk.

9. **Finished**

   You have now finished the installation, proceed to the next step to restart the server.

Restart the Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended at this point to stop the server manually and restart it using the proper script for your OS. From the Tigase base directory enter

.. code:: bash

   ./scripts/tigase.sh stop

   ./scripts/tigase.sh start etc/tigase.conf


.. Note::

   In order to make Tigase XMPP Server start automatically during system startup you should setup startup scripts as described in :ref:`Tigase Script Selection<tigaseScriptStart>`__

To further fine tune the server you should edit ``etc/tigase.conf``. Ensure ``JAVA_HOME`` path is correct, and increase memory if needed using ``JAVA_OPTIONS`` -Xmx (max), and -Xms (initial). You will need to direct Tigase to read settings from this file on startup as follows.

Everything should be running smooth at this point. Check the logfiles in ``logs/`` if you experience any problems.

Verify Tigase is Running
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should see a list of listening ports.

.. code:: bash

   $ lsof -i -P
   COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
   java    18387 tigase  141u  IPv6 22185825      0t0  TCP *:8080 (LISTEN)
   java    18387 tigase  148u  IPv6 22185834      0t0  TCP *:5222 (LISTEN)
   java    18387 tigase  149u  IPv6 22185835      0t0  TCP *:5223 (LISTEN)
   java    18387 tigase  150u  IPv6 22185836      0t0  TCP *:5290 (LISTEN)
   java    18387 tigase  151u  IPv6 22185837      0t0  TCP *:5280 (LISTEN)
   java    18387 tigase  152u  IPv6 22185838      0t0  TCP *:5269 (LISTEN)

.. _winWebInstall:

Windows Instructions for using Web Installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few steps involved with setting up Tigase with the web installer in a Windows environment. Please follow this guide.

First step is to extract the distribution archive in itâ€™s entirety to the intended running directory. Once there, run the ``Setup.bat`` file inside the ``win-stuff`` folder. This will move the necessary files to the correct folders before Tigase begins operation.

From here, you have a few options how to run Tigase; ``run.bat`` will operate Tigase using a java command, or ``tigase.bat`` which will start Tigase using the wrapper. You may also install Tigase and run it as a service.

Once this setup is finished, web installer will continue the same from :ref:`here<connecttoWebInstall>`.
