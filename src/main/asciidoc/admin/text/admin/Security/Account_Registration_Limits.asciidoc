[[accountRegLimit]]
= Account Registration Limits

In order to protect Tigase servers from DOS attacks, a limit on number of account registrations per second has been implemented. This may be configured by adding the following line in the `config.tdsl` file:
[source,dsl]
-----
'registration-throttling' () {
    limit = 10
-----
This setting allows for 10 registrations from a single IP per second. If the limit is exceeded, a `NOT_ALLOWED` error will be returned.

It is possible to create two separate counters as well:
[source,dsl]
-----
'registration-throttling' () {
    limit = 10
}
c2s {
    'registration-throttling' (class: tigase.server.xmppclient.RegistrationThrottling) {
        limit = 3
    }
}
-----
Here we have one for c2s with a limit of 3, and a global for all other connection managers set at 10.

You can also set individual components limits as well:
[source,dsl]
-----
ws2s {
    'registration-throttling' (class: tigase.server.xmppclient.RegistrationThrottling) {
        limit = 7
    }
}
